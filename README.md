This website was created using Jekyll, based on the popular Hyde theme and 
specifically adapted from Alex Gude (https://github.com/agude/agude.github.io).

Note that there are known issues with the Hyde theme for newer versions of 
Jekyll (specifically v4). The repository of Alex Gude contains modified theme 
stylings and bug fixes which make the excellent theme usable even in newer Jekyll versions.
