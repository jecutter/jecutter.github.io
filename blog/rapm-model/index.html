In the last several years, I noticed a wide variety of advanced stats being thrown around by fans and media members alike, seemingly to justify their biased conclusions about players with highly subjective analysis. What’s more, these stats are frequently used as definitive arguments for end-of-season awards, such as MVP.</p> <p>You hear things like: “Player X is clearly superior to Player Y because he ranks higher in categories A, B, and C.” Inevitably, you hear the response: “That may be true, but we all know stats A, B, and C don’t necessarily translate to winning basketball!”</p> <p>Even with such advanced stats, there is sometimes widespread disagreement about a player’s impact or value. In my opinion, the crux of this problem is that these stats are often taken out of the applicable context, perhaps due to lack of transparency.</p> <p>Below, I will discuss my own attempt to “objectively” assess player impact by creating a RAPM model. However, some words are in order about the existing landscape of advanced stats.</p> <h2 id="player-impact-metrics">Player Impact Metrics</h2> <p>Here are just <em>some</em> of the popular advanced player stats out there:</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/per.html">Hollinger’s Player Efficiency Rating (PER)</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html">Justin Kubatko’s Win Shares (WS)</a></li> <li>Plus-Minus/Adjusted Plus-Minus/RAPM</li> <li><a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/bpm2.html">Daniel Myers’ Box Plus-Minus (BPM)</a></li> <li><a href="https://fansided.com/2016/09/08/player-tracking-plus-minus-2015-2016/">Player Tracking Plus-Minus (PT-PM) by Andrew Johnson</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/10740818/introducing-real-plus-minus">ESPN’s Real Plus-Minus (RPM), by Jeremias Engelmann</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.bball-index.com/player-impact-plus-minus/">Player Impact Plus-Minus (PIPM), by Jacob Goldstein of BBall Index</a></li> </ul> <p>These were chosen to give a broad survey of existing methodologies. Follow the links to get a more detailed description of each.</p> <p>Such player impact stats can be roughly categorized as follows: purely box-score based stats, Statistical Plus-Minus (SPM) models, and actual Plus-Minus models (usually based on RAPM).</p> <p>PER and Win Shares belong to the first category. These all-in-one stats use fixed formulae to give a measure of player production from simple box score counting stats (e.g. points, rebounds, assists, turnovers, steals, blocks, personal fouls). The validity of these models lie in the theoretical motivation behind the formulae, which attempt to properly relate box score stats to points gained or lost.</p> <p>BPM and PT-PM are SPM models in the sense that they are also based on box score stats, however they are regressed against existing RAPM datasets to determine the coefficients which weight each feature (RAPM, a variant of plus-minus, will be discussed below). In other words, SPM models are linear estimators of RAPM.</p> <p>It is easy to see why box-score based stats are limited; this can’t possibly encompass the entirety of a player’s impact! Is grabbing a defensive rebound over your teammate more valuable than setting a screen that opens up a shot for Stephen Curry? If a blocked shot goes right back to the opposing team for a put-back, is that block more valuable than solid man-on-man defense?</p> <p>We would like to capture a player’s intangibles, or anything that is not shown by the box score. Plus-Minus based stats may be used for this purpose, since they are based purely on overall team success when the player is on the floor. RAPM, which is a successor of Plus-Minus, is the basis for the other advanced stats above (RPM and PIPM). Let’s take a deeper look at what this means, and why this technique is so prominent in basketball analytics.</p> <h2 id="what-is-regularized-adjusted-plus-minus">What is Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus?</h2> <p>The original <strong>Plus-Minus</strong> stat is simply the point differential a team experiences when a player is on the floor (i.e. points scored by the team minus points scored against the team). However, it is well-established that this metric is deceptive, since a player surrounded by highly skilled teammates will have an inflated Plus-Minus.</p> <p>To answer this, an <strong>Adjusted Plus-Minus (APM)</strong> was created to account for these effects. This essentially means creating a <script type="math/tex">n \times m</script> matrix <script type="math/tex">X</script> of <em>n</em> stints/possessions by <em>m</em> players involved in all those possessions. We can assign entries to <script type="math/tex">1</script> if the player is on offense in the possession, <script type="math/tex">-1</script> if on defense, and <script type="math/tex">0</script> if not on the floor. We can then formulate a matrix equation to solve for the coefficients <script type="math/tex">\beta</script> that give the resulting point differentials <script type="math/tex">Y</script>:</p> <script type="math/tex; mode=display">Y = X \beta \\ X^T Y = X^T X \beta \\ \beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T Y</script> <p>We then approximate the <script type="math/tex">\beta</script> coefficients by solving for the <strong>least-squares solution</strong> to the matrix equation. This yields <script type="math/tex">\beta</script> values which actually represent the player contribution, <em>removing the effect of teammates and opposing players</em>.</p> <p>These coefficients are the player APM values. However, because of multicollinearity between players, the results have enormous variance and essentially result in a meaningless stat. Luckily, there is a Bayesian filtering technique for dealing with this very issue: <em>ridge regression</em>. This is a well-known method for penalizing outlier values back to the central value, to reduce variance at the expense of bias.</p> <p>Ridge regression is performed by modifying the least squares formulation with a diagonal perturbation matrix <script type="math/tex">\lambda I</script>:</p> <script type="math/tex; mode=display">\beta = (X^T Y + \lambda I)^{-1} X^T Y</script> <p>The <script type="math/tex">\lambda</script> value is a model hyperparameter that must be tuned to stabilize the <script type="math/tex">\beta</script> coefficients, but without introducing an enormous bias. Note that in the limit that <script type="math/tex">\lambda \to 0</script>, we recover least squares; in the limit <script type="math/tex">\lambda \to \infty</script>, <script type="math/tex">\beta</script> shrinks to <script type="math/tex">0</script>.</p> <p>In this case, the resulting <script type="math/tex">\beta</script> coefficients are the RAPM values, or the <strong>Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus</strong> for each player. To be clear, these values are no longer <em>absolute points added</em>. This regularization technique results in coefficients that are scaled by a factor dependent on <script type="math/tex">\lambda</script>. The RAPM values should therefore be taken as a relative stat, or a differential contribution.</p> <p>Circling back, how do our advanced stats incorporate RAPM? SPM models like BPM use RAPM <em>strictly as an input</em> to find the model coefficients. RPM and PIPM, on the other hand, are essentially “enhanced” RAPM models which use <strong>Bayesian priors</strong> to constrain the <script type="math/tex">\beta</script> coefficients based on a fit to <em>previous</em> RAPM datasets. As we will discuss, this puts a potentially biased emphasis on box score stats.</p> <h2 id="harvesting-matchups-from-play-by-play-data">Harvesting Matchups from Play-by-Play Data</h2> <p>In order to create my own RAPM model, I constructed a matrix <script type="math/tex">X</script> as explained above, as well as the point differential resulting from each row (each <em>matchup stint</em>). I performed the following procedure:</p> <ul> <li>Scrape play-by-play data from all NBA games over a number of years</li> <li>Parse the PBP data into <em>stints</em>, or matchups between player lineups (that may last a number of possessions)</li> <li>Calculate the point differential resulting from each stint, and from that the <script type="math/tex">Y</script> array (which is actually the plus-minus per 100 possessions)</li> <li>Create a matrix <script type="math/tex">X</script> with <script type="math/tex">n</script> stints (rows) and <script type="math/tex">m</script> NBA players (columns)</li> </ul> <p>To scrape the data, I used a Selenium web driver in Python to parse play-by-play data from <a href="https://stats.nba.com/game/0021600001/playbyplay/">NBA.com</a>. These tables track the score and provide raw text data for analyzing the content of each play. In addition, the starting lineup for each quarter was fetched separately, allowing for player rotations to be tracked throughout a game. This is crucial for monitoring which lineups are out on the floor at any time.</p> <p>The full scraping and wrangling codes can be <a href="https://github.com/jecutter/nba-data-models">found at my Github</a>.</p> <figure> <a href="/files/rapm_model/example_stint_table.png"> <img src="/files/rapm_model/example_stint_table.png" alt="A figure with a caption" /> </a> <figcaption>An example table of lineup matchup stints as a Pandas dataframe. Note that the raw point differential, number of possessions for each stint, and plus-minus per 100 possessions are shown.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Once we’ve isolated each matchup, we can parse the lineups into individual players for the home and away teams. Since we are taking the results of a stint, rather than single possessions, each team has been on both offense and defense. Therefore, we give home team players a matrix entry of <script type="math/tex">1</script>, away team players an entry of <script type="math/tex">-1</script>, and players not on the floor an entry of <script type="math/tex">0</script>. We then take <script type="math/tex">Y</script> to be the home team plus-minus per 100 possessions.</p> <p>This can be done with a Python function as shown below:</p> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">GenerateMatchupMatrix</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">df</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">player_list</span><span class="p">):</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>While <em>k</em>-fold cross-validation is typically used to set <script type="math/tex">\lambda</script>, we can also make sense of our choice by plotting the calculated RAPM as a function of <script type="math/tex">\lambda</script>.</p> <p>It is clear that the <script type="math/tex">\beta</script> values for small <script type="math/tex">\lambda</script> are highly unstable, as certain players experience a lot of variance. We can see that for our optimized <script type="math/tex">\lambda</script> parameter, the best- and worst-RAPM players are stable and begin to converge to the mean.</p> <figure> <a href="/files/rapm_model/rapm_model_tuning.png"> <img src="/files/rapm_model/rapm_model_tuning.png" alt="Plot showing the tuning of the ridge regression lambda parameter." /> </a> <figcaption>A plot showing the regularization of player RAPM ratings as a function of lambda. On the right, we see the tightening of the correlation between RAPM and raw player +/- as lambda is increased.</figcaption> </figure> <p>With these justifications in mind, we can select our hyperparameter with some degree of confidence. However, it is important to point out that our typical notion of unbiased, out-of-sample model testing is compromised here; player performance varies from season to season, and this model is meant to produce a <em>descriptive</em> stat over seasons rather than a <em>predictive</em> one. But more on that later.</p> <h2 id="evaluating-player-rapm-ratings">Evaluating Player RAPM Ratings</h2> <p>Let’s take a look at how various players fare in RAPM.</p> <p>Along with play-by-play data, individual stats were scraped for NBA players, including net rating, BPM, and RPM (again, see my <a href="https://github.com/jecutter/nba-data-models">Github</a>). Note that <em>net rating</em> is actually just the player’s raw plus-minus per 100 possessions, which doesn’t take into account the caliber of a player’s supporting cast. Below, we see the top 10 and bottom 10 players in RAPM, along with these other metrics.</p> <figure> <a href="/files/rapm_model/ordered_players_rapm.png"> <img src="/files/rapm_model/ordered_players_rapm.png" alt="A figure with a caption" /> </a> <figcaption></figcaption> </figure> <p>Note: only players averaging <script type="math/tex">> 20</script> minutes per game are shown.</p> <p>It is clear that some players with great RAPM also have a high net rating, but this is not always the case. While there is overall correlation, we have to account for the fact that strengths/deficiencies are sometimes masked by context.</p> <p>Overall, the results are sensible. Stephen Curry has league-leading RAPM over the last 3 years, which is largely considered to be the era of “small ball” and 3-point shooting that he ushered in. It is interesting that the top 5 players are <em>all</em> guards – smaller players, 3 of whom are considered excellent 2-way players and all of whom can shoot 3-pointers and make plays for others. Notice also that some players, especially Damian Lillard and Jrue Holiday, are highly underrated by ESPN’s RPM.</p> <p>On the other hand, the players with the worst RAPM tend to be either aging, inexperienced, or considered lazy on at least one end of the floor. For instance, Trae Young is a rookie considered to be one of the worst defenders in the league.</p> <h2 id="comparing-with-other-advanced-stats">Comparing with Other Advanced Stats</h2> <p>To understand what we’ve calculated better, and how it relates to existing metrics, we can examine correlations with a variety of box score and advanced stats.</p> <p>A useful tool for doing this is to make a Pearson correlation heatmap. This allows us to examine relationships between a large number of features and potentially informs us on what dependencies to examine further.</p> <figure> <a href="/files/rapm_model/pearson_correlation_rapm.png"> <img src="/files/rapm_model/pearson_correlation_rapm.png" alt="Plot showing Pearson correlation of RAPM with other advanced stats." /> </a> <figcaption></figcaption> </figure> <p>Shown in the matrix above are correlations between various player statistics averaged over the 2017-2019 seasons, including the previously discussed PER, BPM, RPM, and RAPM (within the green lines). The other abbreviated stats are: true shooting %, field goal attempts per 100 poss., free throw rate, opponent field goal %, assist-to-turnover ratio, rebound rate, blocks per 100 poss., and steals per 100 poss.</p> <p>We can summarize some interesting points from this table:</p> <ul> <li>PER has a much higher correlation with player usage than the other stats (it rewards players who simply attempt more shots)</li> <li>PER, BPM, and RPM all have a slight correlation with player height, while RAPM is completely uncorrelated with height</li> <li>PER, BPM, and RPM give much more weight to rebounds and blocks than RAPM (interestingly, this is not as true for steals)</li> <li>RAPM is the most correlated with opponent field goal %, which serves as a proxy for man-on-man defense that is hard to quantify</li> <li>RAPM is less correlated with true shooting % than the other stats, though this is also true for the free throw rate (and free throws factor in to true shooting)</li> <li>PER and RPM are more correlated with BPM than RAPM.</li> </ul> <p>Taking all these observations together, it is reasonable to hypothesize that 1) other advanced stats appear to favor big men, including stats that are typical for big men (e.g. rebounds and blocks), and 2) ESPN’s RPM, one of the most popular and quoted advanced stats, appears to be highly dependent on box score stats.</p> <p>The explanation for this is that the RPM methodology uses box-score priors calculated from a historical RAPM dataset (which I have been unable to find). These <strong>Bayesian priors</strong> are then used in the ridge regression to constrain the range of <script type="math/tex">\beta</script> for various players, thus pre-estimating their value using their box score stats. While these priors are proprietary and not publicly available, it appears that the box-score component is significant.</p> <h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2> <p>This exercise to create a minimally-biased player ranking is informative when comparing to the publicly available advanced stats, because it shows just how subjective these models are.</p> <p>In Bayesian statistics, it is common to employ Bayesian priors to constrain results. However, the choice of these priors and the importance of each feature is inherently subjective, and somewhat defeats the original purpose of the RAPM method: to measure a player’s overall impact and intangibles. If man-on-man defense is considered less valuable than a block, if a rebound is given more weight than a well-executed pass, and a taller player is given the edge over a shorter one, then our model loses its context-independence.</p> <p>The true power of metrics like ESPN’s RPM is its <em>predictive</em> power. By regressing against a very large RAPM dataset to calculate priors, it can then predict a player’s future RAPM with better accuracy. However, RPM is often used as a <em>descriptive</em> stat to explain why a particular season’s box score stats, on which the model itself is tuned, give a particular player an edge. This may be circular, flawed logic, as it inevitably leads to underestimating over-achievers and vice versa.</p> <p>As a descriptive stat, pure RAPM models may still be the most objective. It may not accurately tell us what impact a player will have next season, but yet again, can any stat do that reliably given unavoidable year-to-year variations? No all-in-one stat gives a perfect player assessment, and every stat must be used appropriately.</p> </article> <!-- Share Buttons --> <aside role="complementary" class="sharing"> <!-- The Buttons --> <ul class="rrssb-buttons clearfix"> <!-- Facebook --> <li class="rrssb-facebook"> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://jecutter.github.io/blog/rapm-model/" class="popup"> <span class="rrssb-icon"> <svg xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 29 29"><path d="M26.4 0H2.6C1.714 0 0 1.715 0 2.6v23.8c0 .884 1.715 2.6 2.6 2.6h12.393V17.988h-3.996v-3.98h3.997v-3.062c0-3.746 2.835-5.97 6.177-5.97 1.6 0 2.444.173 2.845.226v3.792H21.18c-1.817 0-2.156.9-2.156 2.168v2.847h5.045l-.66 3.978h-4.386V29H26.4c.884 0 2.6-1.716 2.6-2.6V2.6c0-.885-1.716-2.6-2.6-2.6z"/></svg> </span> <span class="rrssb-text">Facebook</span> </a> </li> <!-- Twitter --> <li class="rrssb-twitter"> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=An+RAPM+Model+to+Assess+NBA+Players&amp;via=jecutter92&amp;url=https://jecutter.github.io/blog/rapm-model/" class="popup"> <span class="rrssb-icon"> <svg xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 28 28"><path d="M24.253 8.756C24.69 17.08 18.297 24.182 9.97 24.62a15.093 15.093 0 0 1-8.86-2.32c2.702.18 5.375-.648 7.507-2.32a5.417 5.417 0 0 1-4.49-3.64c.802.13 1.62.077 2.4-.154a5.416 5.416 0 0 1-4.412-5.11 5.43 5.43 0 0 0 2.168.387A5.416 5.416 0 0 1 2.89 4.498a15.09 15.09 0 0 0 10.913 5.573 5.185 5.185 0 0 1 3.434-6.48 5.18 5.18 0 0 1 5.546 1.682 9.076 9.076 0 0 0 3.33-1.317 5.038 5.038 0 0 1-2.4 2.942 9.068 9.068 0 0 0 3.02-.85 5.05 5.05 0 0 1-2.48 2.71z"/></svg> </span> <span class="rrssb-text">Twitter</span> </a> </li> <!-- LinkedIn --> <li class="rrssb-linkedin"> <!-- Replace href with your meta and URL information --> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https://jecutter.github.io/blog/rapm-model/&amp;title=An+RAPM+Model+to+Assess+NBA+Players&amp;summary=Developing+a+lineup-independent+NBA+player+impact+model+using+ridge+regression+techniques+on+play-by-play+data.%0A&amp;source=AlexGude.com" class="popup"> <span class="rrssb-icon"> <svg xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 28 28"><path d="M25.424 15.887v8.447h-4.896v-7.882c0-1.98-.71-3.33-2.48-3.33-1.354 0-2.158.91-2.514 1.802-.13.315-.162.753-.162 1.194v8.216h-4.9s.067-13.35 0-14.73h4.9v2.087c-.01.017-.023.033-.033.05h.032v-.05c.65-1.002 1.812-2.435 4.414-2.435 3.222 0 5.638 2.106 5.638 6.632zM5.348 2.5c-1.676 0-2.772 1.093-2.772 2.54 0 1.42 1.066 2.538 2.717 2.546h.032c1.71 0 2.77-1.132 2.77-2.546C8.056 3.593 7.02 2.5 5.344 2.5h.005zm-2.48 21.834h4.896V9.604H2.867v14.73z"/></svg> </span> <span class="rrssb-text">LinkedIn</span> </a> </li> <!-- RRSSB Scripts --> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"></script> <script> window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="js/vendor/jquery.1.10.2.min.js"><\/script>') </script> <script src="/public/js/rrssb.min.js"></script> </ul> </aside> <!-- Related and Recent Posts --> <!-- Related Posts --> <aside role="complementary" class="related"> <h2>Related Posts</h2> <div class="card-grid"> <div class="card-element card-image"> <a href="/blog/player-comp/"> <img src="/files/player_comp/imgonline-com-ua-twotoone-Xzq8ZtqJyh.jpg" alt="Default image for player comparison project.
